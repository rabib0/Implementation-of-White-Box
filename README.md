# AES 128-bit Encryption Utility

## Synopsis

This repository contains a simple implementation of a 128-bit AES encryption and decryption utility. The encryption tool (`encrypt.cpp`) takes a plaintext message and a 128-bit key as input and generates an encrypted message stored in a file (`message.aes`). The decryption tool (`decrypt.cpp`) reads the encrypted message and the key, providing the original plaintext message as output.

## File Details
- **encrypt.cpp:** Source file for the encryption utility.
- **decrypt.cpp:** Source file for the decryption utility.
- **structures.h:** Header file providing structures and Key Expansion functions for use in the main program files.
- **keyfile:** Specify the encryption key in this file. The key must be a 128-bit key in hexadecimal format with a space between each hex value (e.g., `01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10`).
- **message.aes:** Generated by the encryption tool, this file stores the encrypted message. It is read and decrypted by the decryption tool.

## Compilation
If using the g++ compiler, you can compile the encryption and decryption utilities separately using the following commands:
```bash
g++ encrypt.cpp -o encrypt
g++ decrypt.cpp -o decrypt
